 <h2>Romina Rambarran</h2>
    <h3>Manager of the design team.</h3>
   <p>Greener Communities is important to me because 
     its important to understand the significance of 
     recycling and that it helps prevent enviromental
     losses. I help out my teamates whenever they need
     help. I also take over when ever our team leader
     is absent. And I help create helpful ideas for 
     our game.</p>
